// Description: Messier Marathon on March 20, 2020. The data for the script are taken from GaoXing's observation log: http://www.xjltp.com/2_huodong/2_030301.htm 参照一个梅西耶天体马拉松的真实历程记录（高兴老师的观测报表http://www.xjltp.com/2_huodong/2_030301.htm），用Stellarium实时模拟了2020年春季共110个梅西耶天体的全程观测历程。里面对跑梅马的心得和感受也有一定记录，可以作为春季梅马的预习工具。
